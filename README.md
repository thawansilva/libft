# Libft Project

This project consists in recreate some pattern functions that exists in C. In some projects of 42 School, it's forbidden to use some pattern functions in C, so this project was developed to build our own functions and use in the future.

### What I learned:

- Data Structures;
- Debugging skills with GDB;
- Break the project in small steps;
- RTFM;
- Creativity in solving problems;
